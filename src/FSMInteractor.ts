// Finite State Machine driven interactor v1.0a 10/2023
// by Scott Hudson, CMU HCII 
//
// This and accompanying files provides classes and types which implement a generic
// interactor whose appearance and behavior is controlled by a Finite State Machine (FSM), 
// along with a set of "regions" which determine its appearance, as well as how 
// high-level input events for it are synthized and dispatched. See the comments
// in various classes for details.

//===================================================================
// Class for an interactive object controlled by a finite state machine (FSM).
// Objects of this class have a position on the screen (the location of their top-left
// corner within the HTML canvas object associated with thier parent (Root) object), 
// Along with an FSM object which specifies, and partially imlements, their behavior.
// This class is repsonsible for using the FSM object to draw all the current region 
// images within the FSM, and for dispatching events to the FSM to drive its behavior.
// Note that this object has a position, but not an explicit size, and that no clipping
// of its output is being done.  Regions within the FSM are positioned in the coordinate
// system of this object (i.e., WRT its top-left corner), and have a size that 
// establishes a bouding box for input purposes (i.e., indicateing which event positions 
// are considered "inside" or "over" the region for input purposes).  However, region 
// image displays are not not limited to that bounding box and are not clipped (except 
// by the containing HTML canvas object).  See the FSM and Root classes for more details.
